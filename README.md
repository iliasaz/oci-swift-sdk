# oci-swift-sdk
Unofficial and unsupported Oracle Cloud Infrastructure SDK for Swift

## Why
I love Swift, I use OCI because it's good, and I'd like to use OCI services for my Swift projects. And because there is no OCI SDK for Swift as of today.  

## Approach
I'm going to add support for the services that I need at the moment. If you would like to add support for a service you need, please go ahead, and please submit a PR so that others can find your implementation here as well.

## TODO List
- [x] API Key authN
- [x] GenAI inference (common models)
- [ ] Instance Principal authN
- [ ] Resource Principal authN
- [ ] Object Storage
- [ ] Container Instances
- [ ] GenAI inference (custom models)
